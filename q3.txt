   'To find the Km value of hexokinase for glucose in humans using the BRENDA SOAP API, the following Python code can be used. This code makes a call to the BRENDA SOAP API to retrieve the Km values for the enzyme hexokinase when acting on glucose in humans. The enzyme hexokinase corresponds to the EC number 2.7.1.1. The organism of interest is Homo sapiens. The code is structured to first import the necessary modules, then define the WSDL URL, the user\'s hashed password, and finally make the API call to retrieve the Km values. The result is printed out, which will include the Km value among other related information. \n Imports: from zeep import Client\nimport hashlib \n Code: wsdl = "https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/soap/brenda_zeep.wsdl"\npassword = hashlib.sha256("Jeious2468".encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()\nclient = Client(wsdl)\nparameters = ("siavash.raissi@tufts.edu",password,"ecNumber*2.7.1.1", "kmValue*", "substrate*glucose", "organism*Homo sapiens", "commentary*", "literature*")\nresultString = client.service.getKmValue(*parameters)\nprint(resultString)'),
